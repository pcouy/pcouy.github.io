Hey there, I'm Pierre Couy â€“ a professional software developer and computer science teacher who's passionate about all things tech. I'm starting this blog because I love sharing my passion with the world and hope to inspire and connect with like-minded individuals.

Through this blog, I'll be sharing my experiences, ideas, and knowledge on various topics related to programming and computer science. I'll also be showcasing personal projects that I've been working on and sharing insights and tips from my teaching experience.

As a tinkerer at heart, I'm always exploring new software and hardware, and I'm excited to share my discoveries and learnings with you. Having an audience will also motivate me to finish and write about a lot of stuff I tinker with but then gets lost because I forget about it or never touch it again.

So whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, join me on this exciting journey as we explore the world of computers together. Let's geek out together!
